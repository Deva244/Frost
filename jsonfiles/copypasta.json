  "kira":"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.",

  "heaven":"Yeah these guys have no idea what they're talking about. First of all, What you need is my Stand 'The World'. What you can find beyond the powers of my Stand is where you need to go in order to find Heaven. What you need is a trustworthy friend. He must be someone capable of controlling his own desires. He must be someone who is not interested in political power, fame, wealth, or sexual desire, and who chooses the will of God before the law of humans. Will I, DIO, be able to meet someone like this one day? What I also need is the lives of more than 36 humans who have sinned, because those who have sinned harbor a strong power within. There are 14 phrases that one must keep in mind: Spiral staircase, Rhinoceros Beetle, Ruined town, Fig tart, Rhinoceros Beetle, Via Delarosso, Rhinoceros Beetle, Singularity point, Giotto, Angel, Hydrangea, Rhinoceros Beetle, Singularity Point, Secret Emperor. I'll engrave these words onto my Stand so I won't forget them. What is most necessary is 'courage'; I must have the courage to destroy my Stand momentarily. As it disintegrates, my Stand will absorb the souls of the 36 sinners and will give birth to something utterly new. Whatever is born will 'awaken'. It will show interest in the 14 words that my trusted friend will utter... My friend will trust me and I will become his 'friend'. Lastly, I need an appropriate location. North latitude, 28 degrees, 24 minutes, West longitude 80 degrees, 36 minutes... Go there and wait for the New Moon... That's when Heaven will come.",
